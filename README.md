### @contileaks

This repo will contain my work in progress on the Conti leaks.

The first item is the parsed and translated log of the conti chats, both from 2020 and 2021-2022.

See https://share.vx-underground.org/Conti/ for these logs.
I've added it both as a 7z and plain json, because the original is 43M.

See the work by @AZobec https://medium.com/@arnozobec/analyzing-conti-leaks-without-speaking-russian-only-methodology-f5aecc594d1b for fun things to do with it.

Added some slight modifications to the original `translate.py` to make it work for me.
