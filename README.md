This repo will contain my work in progress on the Conti leaks.

The first item is the parsed and translated log of the conti chats, both from 2020 and 2021-2022.
See https://share.vx-underground.org/Conti/ for these logs.
I've added it as a 7z, because the json is 44M.
See the work by @AZobec https://medium.com/@arnozobec/analyzing-conti-leaks-without-speaking-russian-only-methodology-f5aecc594d1b for fun things to do with it.
